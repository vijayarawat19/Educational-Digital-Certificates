# Educational Digital Certificates with Blockchain Integration
## Overview
This project aims to create a secure and tamper-proof educational digital certificate system using blockchain technology. Digital certificates are an essential part of the education system, and ensuring their authenticity and integrity is crucial. By leveraging blockchain, we provide a solution that enhances security and prevents forgery of educational certificates.
## Features

- **Blockchain Integration:** We've integrated blockchain technology to store and manage certificate records. This ensures that once a certificate is issued, it becomes part of an immutable and tamper-proof ledger.

- **Immutable Records:** Every certificate issued is recorded on the blockchain, making it impossible to alter or delete without proper authorization. This enhances the trustworthiness of the certificates.

- **Data Integrity:** To ensure the integrity of certificate data, we generate unique hashcodes for each certificate. This means that any unauthorized changes to the certificate will be immediately detected.

- **Ease of Verification:** Recipients and employers can easily verify the authenticity of certificates by checking the blockchain records. This simplifies the verification process and reduces the risk of accepting fake certificates.

## How It Works

1. **Certificate Issuance:** When a certificate is issued, it is recorded on the blockchain along with a unique hashcode generated from the certificate's data.

2. **Verification:** Anyone with access to the blockchain can verify the certificate's authenticity by comparing the stored hashcode with the one generated from the certificate data.

3. **Tamper-Proof:** Since the certificate data is stored on the blockchain, it is virtually impossible for anyone to tamper with the certificate without leaving a trace.

## Usage

To get started with this project, follow these steps:
